          <p><strong>More than ever, consumers want healthy alternatives.</strong></p>
          <p>People want real foods with a short list of familiar and natural ingredients. They’re demanding natural versus processed, and that’s where we step in.<br>
            As an NKD Pizza franchisee, you have the ability to bring pizza with made only from ingredients that haven’t been processed, stuffed with additives or tinkered with in any way to your community. You’ll be delivering great tasting pizza made with 10 ancient grains that doesn’t put you into a food coma- it actually gives you energy. Founded in late 2006 as one small store in New Orleans in an area that flooded during hurricane Katrina, NKD Pizza (originally named World’s Healthiest Pizza) was launched as an ambitious business model that sought to change the nutritional profile of fast food in America. By way of example, NKD Pizza is demonstrating that pizza does not have to be part of the problem in the epidemic of obesity and chronic disease, but in fact can be part of the solution. We believe enough is enough: it’s time the $30 billion dollar pizza industry rolled up its sleeves and repositioned pizza in the way Americans want to eat. That'’s why we offer pizza our guests feel good about eating and we feel good about serving.Those in the pizza industry who do not adapt and evolve with the new way consumers are looking at good choices will be left behind.</p>

              <p><strong>business model</strong></p>
              <p>For the NKD Pizza business model, we chose the most successful one available – carry out and delivery, no dining. We hacked this model and skinned it with a cool, engaging brand and offered up a product that makes people feel good about eating pizza again.
                By choosing this model we also entered the hyper-disciplined world of an 8-10 minute delivery area and an operational promise that if you order from us, you can plan the next 30 minutes of your life. It’s about small spaces (800 to 1,200 sq ft) and limited build out. You don’t need to be in prime locations as 70-80% of our business is delivery. It’s about easy in and out for delivery drivers. We offer all the sophistication and efficiency of the major national chains, with a product that can promote healthier communities and is socially rewarding.</p>
              <p><strong>what kind of partners are we looking for?</strong></p>
              <p>We are looking to partner with entrepreneurs that have vision and drive. If you are interested in seizing opportunities others miss and creating sustainable solutions to change society for the better, then you just might bethe type of partner we are looking for. Oh yeah, you must also have a strong desire to make money.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We are awarding franchising rights all across the U.S. and internationally and are very interested in multi-unit developers (minimum of 10 units per agreement within a tight cluster). If you think you have what it takes, fill out our application. There are still opportunities throughout the major markets, so the sooner you start, the better.</p>
              <p><strong>support</strong></p>
              <p>We have a desire to support you as you set out to start your own NKD Pizza franchise. Whether it’s site selection, construction assistance or ongoing support long after the doors have opened, our experienced operations professionals will be with you every step of the way, offering the tools and guidance you will need to ensure your NKD Pizza store is a success.</p>
